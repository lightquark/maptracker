Map Tracker
==========================================================

This is my very first Android application.
I made it for study purposes and also for using it during thr travelling.

The app is based on 2 tutorials:
- https://github.com/android/location-samples/tree/master/LocationUpdatesBackgroundKotlin/app
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/polygon-tutorial

Technologies:
--------------

- Android SDK v33 (Android 13)
- Google Maps SDK
- Kotlin (JVM 17)
- Gradle
- Room library (abstraction layer over SQLite)
- Android Studio as IDE
